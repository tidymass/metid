Read MSP Data from MoNA}
\usage{
read_msp_mona(file, threads = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{A character vector specifying the file path(s) to the MSP file(s).}

\item{threads}{Numeric, the number of threads to use for parallel processing. Defaults to `3`.}
}
\value{
A list where each element contains:
\item{info}{A data frame with metadata for each spectrum (typically containing identifiers like m/z, intensity, and other descriptors).}
\item{spec}{A data frame with the `mz` (mass-to-charge ratio) and `intensity` values of the MS2 spectrum.}
}
\description{
This function reads and processes MSP data files from the MoNA (MassBank of North America) database. The function parses the MSP file and extracts both metadata (such as m/z and intensity) and the spectrum information for each entry. The MSP data is then returned as a list.
}
\details{
This function is designed to handle MSP data specifically from MoNA. The data is organized into a structured list, where each list element corresponds to a spectrum with associated metadata and peak information.
